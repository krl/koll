very simple program to create a logfile of files worked on
can be used to keep track of work related projects for billing

just put this in elisp path and (require 'koll) in your config to have a go.


by default koll writes it's entries to files ~/.koll/year-month like this:

[2010-01-27 20:45] /home/krl/hax/koll/koll.el
[2010-01-27 20:57] /home/krl/hax/koll/koll.el
[2010-01-27 21:25] /home/krl/hax/koll/koll.el
[2010-01-27 21:57] /home/krl/conf/emacs.el
