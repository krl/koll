;; very simple program to create a logfile of files worked on
;; can be used to keep track of work related projects for billing

;; just put this in elisp path and (require 'koll) in your config to have a go.

;; alist containing latest file writeout
(setf *koll-latest* nil
      ;; koll interval is the number of seconds that should pass between 
      ;; log entries of the same file. default 10 minutes.
      *koll-interval* (* 60 10)
      ;; this must exist
      *koll-logdir* "~/.koll"
      *koll-filename* "%Y-%m"
      *koll-timestamp* "\[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\] ")

(unless (file-directory-p *koll-logdir*)
  (if (file-exists-p *koll-logdir*)
      (error "*koll-logdir* is a file!")
    (make-directory *koll-logdir*)))

(defun koll-hook ()
  (let* ((file (buffer-file-name))
	 (time (string-to-number (format-time-string "%s")))
	 (latest (aget *koll-latest* file)))
     (when (and file
		(not (and (fboundp 'tramp-tramp-file-p)
			  (tramp-tramp-file-p file)))
		(or (not latest) (> (- time latest) *koll-interval*)))
      ;; write logfile
      (shell-command (concat "echo " (format-time-string *koll-timestamp*) file " >> " *koll-logdir* "/" (format-time-string *koll-filename*)))
      (aput '*koll-latest* file time)
